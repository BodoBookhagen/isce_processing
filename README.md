Installation, guides, and scripts for processing radar scenes with ISCE

These guides and scripts only work when you have installed the full ISCE suite (see here http://earthdef.caltech.edu/).

The installation scripts describe how to setup the python environments for ISCE and GIAnT on servers that already have ISCE installed.

Setup ISCE:
