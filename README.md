Installation, guides, and scripts for processing radar scenes with ISCE

These guides and scripts only work when you have installed the full ISCE suite (see here http://earthdef.caltech.edu/).

The installation scripts describe how to setup the python environments for ISCE and GIAnT on servers that already have ISCE installed.

Setup ISCE:
Start with [install_isce201704_ubuntu1604_for_users.txt](install_isce201704_ubuntu1604_for_users.txt) and follow instructions

Setup GIAnT (assume ISCE is already setup):
Start with [install_giant_ubuntu1604_for_users.txt](install_giant_ubuntu1604_for_users.txt) and follow instructions
